# MemoryMappings in Solidity 

You can define and use mappings in memory in solidity using this library. Don't trifle with writing to storage when you need a mapping, use this memory library instead.

Read/write to the memory map is cheaper in gas than the analogue in storage. In best case read/write are O(log n).

See tests for example usage.

Not audited. Use at your own risk.
